Data is more powerful when we shart it with others! Drawing analysis from a previous project, API-Challenge, create a dashboard using HTML and CSS as well as Bootstrap.

**Objective**

Create a visualization dashboard website with a navigation menu containing a dropdown menu on each of the following individual pages:

  * Landing page:
    *  Explanation of project
    *  Links to each visualization page in a side bar
  * Four visualizations pages:
    *  With descriptive title and description of the plot
    *  Visualization for selected comparison
  * Comparison page:
    *  Displays all visualizations on one page
  * Data page:
    *  Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations
  
The website should also be responsive based on the size of the screen.
